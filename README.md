OXAUDIT: Smart Contract Static Analysis Tool

OXAUDIT is an advanced static analysis tool tailored for Solidity smart contracts, designed to enhance the security and efficiency of Ethereum-based applications. Built with a focus on precision, speed, and ease of integration, OXAUDIT enables developers to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, improve code clarity, and optimize performance. Leveraging its modular architecture, OXAUDIT integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines and provides flexible options for detecting a wide array of common smart contract security issues.

Here's a proposed section for your whitepaper, covering **OXAUDIT** and detailing how it works, including instructions on usage and features.

#### How OXAUDIT Works

OXAUDIT operates by statically analyzing Solidity code, identifying potential vulnerabilities through a comprehensive set of built-in detectors. It examines contracts at a syntactic and semantic level to identify coding patterns that may pose risks, such as unprotected functions, reentrancy vulnerabilities, or costly operations within loops. The tool’s analysis engine generates an intermediate representation of the code to facilitate detailed, high-precision assessments without executing the code itself.

This static analysis approach is particularly effective for blockchain security as it can identify vulnerabilities early in the development process. By scanning for known issues and highlighting risky patterns, OXAUDIT helps developers ensure the robustness of their smart contracts before deployment.

#### Key Features of OXAUDIT

- **Low False Positives**: OXAUDIT’s detectors are fine-tuned to reduce false positives, offering developers actionable insights with minimal noise.
- **Broad Detector Set**: OXAUDIT comes with over 15 pre-configured detectors that target common vulnerabilities like uninitialized storage variables, integer overflows, and unauthorized self-destruct calls.
- **Continuous Integration Compatibility**: Integrates smoothly with GitHub Actions and other CI/CD platforms, enabling automated analysis with each code update.
- **Customizable API**: Supports the development of custom detectors in Python, allowing organizations to adapt OXAUDIT to their specific security requirements.
- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Uses an IR layer to perform precise analyses and generate call graphs, control flow graphs, and other contract summaries for comprehensive security reviews.

#### Guide to Using OXAUDIT

Below is a step-by-step guide for installing, configuring, and running OXAUDIT in a development environment.

##### Installation

OXAUDIT can be installed via several methods, depending on your project’s requirements.

1. **Using Pip**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install oxaudit
   ```

2. **Using Git**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/oxaudit.git && cd oxaudit
   python3 -m pip install .
   ```

3. **Using Docker**:
   Pull the Docker image for OXAUDIT and mount the necessary directories:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-repo/oxaudit
   docker run -it -v /home/share:/share your-repo/oxaudit
   ```

##### Basic Usage

OXAUDIT can analyze individual Solidity files or entire projects. The following commands illustrate how to perform an analysis:

1. **Analyzing an Entire Project**:
   In the root directory of your Solidity project, run:
   ```bash
   oxaudit .
   ```
   This command will analyze all Solidity files in the project and produce a summary report of detected vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyzing a Single File**:
   For specific files without dependencies, specify the file path directly:
   ```bash
   oxaudit path/to/your/contract.sol
   ```

##### Integration with Continuous Integration (CI)

OXAUDIT supports CI integration to automate security checks for each commit. To configure OXAUDIT in GitHub Actions, add the following steps in your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run OXAUDIT
  uses: your-repo/oxaudit-action@main
```

##### Generating Reports

OXAUDIT provides detailed reports in various formats. For instance, to generate a Markdown report, use:

```bash
oxaudit [target] --report markdown
```

This command will output a comprehensive report, with each identified issue listed alongside its impact and suggested fixes.

#### Understanding OXAUDIT Detectors

OXAUDIT includes a broad set of detectors designed to capture a wide range of security vulnerabilities. Below are some examples:

| Detector                  | Description                                              | Impact  | Confidence |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|
| uninitialized-storage     | Detects uninitialized storage usage                      | High    | High       |
| reentrancy                | Detects reentrancy vulnerabilities                       | High    | High       |
| unprotected-functions     | Identifies unprotected functions                         | Medium  | Medium     |
| integer-overflow          | Detects potential integer overflows                      | High    | High       |
| missing-zero-check        | Identifies missing zero address validation               | Medium  | High       |
| tx-origin-auth            | Detects risky tx.origin-based authentication             | High    | Medium     |

For a comprehensive list of detectors, see the full OXAUDIT documentation.

#### Advanced Analysis Tools

OXAUDIT also includes several auxiliary tools to assist developers in performing in-depth analyses:

- **oxaudit-check-upgradeability**: Assesses safety for upgradeable contracts.
- **oxaudit-read-storage**: Reads storage values from smart contracts.
- **oxaudit-interface**: Generates interface files for contracts.

To use these tools, simply run the corresponding command, such as:

```bash
oxaudit-check-upgradeability path/to/your/contract.sol
```
