## üåü Features

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection**: Detects common vulnerabilities in Solidity code with minimal false positives.
- **Accurate Issue Location**: Pinpoints exact locations of issues in the source code.
- **Seamless CI Integration**: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate code analysis.
- **Detailed Contract Analysis**: Offers in-depth information on contracts through built-in printers.
- **Customizable API**: Allows for the development of new detectors and analyses.
- **Supports Multiple Solidity Versions**: Analyzes code from Solidity version >= 0.4.
- **Optimized Performance**: Executes analysis in under a second per contract.

## üñ®Ô∏è Printers

OXAUDIT provides several printers for quick and in-depth reviews.

### Quick Review Printers

- `human-summary`: Prints a human-readable summary of the contract.
- `loc`: Counts lines of code (LOC), source lines of code (SLOC), and comments.

### In-Depth Review Printers

- `call-graph`: Exports the call graph of the contract.
- `cfg`: Exports the Control Flow Graph (CFG).

To run a printer:

```bash
oxaudit --print [printer-name]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

OXAUDIT includes several auxiliary tools:

- `oxaudit-check-upgradeability`: Review upgradeable contract safety.
- `oxaudit-read-storage`: Reads storage values from contracts.
- `oxaudit-interface`: Generates an interface for a contract.

For more details, refer to the **[Tool Documentation](https://docs.oxaudit.com/basics/markdown)**.
