## üñ®Ô∏è **Printers**

OXAUDIT offers several printers for quick and in-depth reviews:

### Quick Review Printers

- `human-summary`: Prints a human-readable contract summary.
- `loc`: Counts lines of code (LOC), source lines of code (SLOC), and comments.

### In-Depth Review Printers

- `call-graph`: Exports the call graph of the contract.
- `cfg`: Exports the Control Flow Graph (CFG).

To run a printer:

```bash
oxaudit --print [printer-name]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**

OXAUDIT includes several auxiliary tools:

- `oxaudit-check-upgradeability`: Review upgradeable contract safety.
- `oxaudit-read-storage`: Reads storage values from contracts.
- `oxaudit-interface`: Generates an interface for a contract.

For more details, check the **[Tool Documentation](#)**.
